I created an index.html web page that showed the location of the 4 year universities in Washington state. 
It is also accompanied by a table that shows the average gpa of accepted students for each of these colleges along with the size of each university by population. There is also a sort button built in, which allows you to sort the colleges from the college with the highest average gpa admitted to lowest average GPA admitted. The map is overlayed with a transparent map showing all the counties in washington, so that you are able to see which county each college is located in.
